This directory is for files that the citydash Docker image will have
available at build time. It is an appropriate place to put scripts that
will construct the initial state of a container. Since this directory is
copied during initialization and not shared with the host, changes you
make to this directory will not be shared between the host (i.e., your
computer) and the container.
